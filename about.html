							<h1>About Page for Dome1 <br>

								<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
								<p>The Chair for Circular Engineering for Architecture is focused on digitalization for circularity in the built environment. Dome1 is our flagship project of exploratory research in techniques that may be adopted to facilitate reuse.</p>
								<p>In October of 2021 the CEA Chair and Materiuum disassembled a part of an old Fiat factory in Geneva, Switzerland. The recovered materials were brought to ETH Zurich for storage and the eventual reuse in our flagship project. </p>
								<p>This github pages site acts as our prototype database for storing and sorting digital information on the primary building components used in this reuse project. Here you can find the list of components connected to their physical product via a QR Code. Below is an explanation of our digitization techniques used. </p>
								<hr />
								<h2>Digitization Technique 1: Algorithmic Design Optimization</h2>
								<p>CEA salvaged a discrete stock of wooden members from the Fiat factory. The desired structure to be built was a geodesic dome. To match the existing stock with the needed stock for a new design an algorithm was developed to dictate the appropriate cuts of the existing stock and matching to the location of the new structure. This algorithm optimized for cutting into as little of the existing materials as possible. </p>
								<hr />
								<h2>Digitization Technique 2: Laser Engraved QR Codes</h2>
								<p>Because our primary structural components were made of wood, we explored the application of quick response (QR) codes via laser engraving. This technique ensures a permanent association between the physical and digital representation of the components. Data is stored on the history and properties of the material so that building owners, operators, and future material users have full transparency of the material.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2>Digitization Technique 3: CNC Mill</h2>
								<p>The nodes used to connect the structural components were cut cross-sections of salvaged PVC pipe. Because of the limited thickness of the pipe we noticed deformation of material, and because of the flexible nature of the material it allowed for increased contortion and vibration of the entire dome. Our solution was to cut caps out of salvaged OSB to place inside the pipe cross-section and increase strength and rigidity. To accomplish this we used a computer numerical control (CNC) mill to rapidly and with precision cut out these caps for the nodes.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2>Future Vision</h2>
								<p>Though this site is built up to only represent one project, the vision is to connect multiple project pages for a meta-database of project parts. The database itself may continue to evolve to contain further product information such as EPDs, 3D model files, and drawing sets.This level of accessibility and interoperability facilitates the circular economy through increasing access to information.  </p>
